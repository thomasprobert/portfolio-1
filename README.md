# Rose Tinted retro arcade site
Rose Tinted is a site designed to advertise a retro style arcade. Rose Tinted will be used to find information about the company, largely its location, opening times, cost and what is available whilst there. I am looking to add a more definitive list of whats available, as well as more user interactivity.
